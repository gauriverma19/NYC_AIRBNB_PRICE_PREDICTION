# NYC_AIRBNB_PRICE_PREDICTION

This project focuses on predicting prices for AIRBNB in NYC. I considered it a supervised regression problem.
I approached it using Linear and Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Linear SVR and KNN.

Despite the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, I can conclude that Random Forest performed the best for this problem.
